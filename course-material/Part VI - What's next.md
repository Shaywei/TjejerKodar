# Part VI - What's next?

Thank you for taking the Hackathon Pro course!  
I hope you've enjoyed it, learned a few things and perhaps even going to expand on your knowledge in the future!  

To help you do the latter, here are some useful resources to read about cool / creepy uses people found for APIs:  

1. [Graphing when your FB friends are awake](https://defaultnamehere.tumblr.com/post/139351766005/graphing-when-your-facebook-friends-are-awake#139351766005)
2. [Stalking your FB friends on Tinder](https://defaultnamehere.tumblr.com/post/147747146865/stalking-your-facebook-friends-on-tinder)
3. [Apartment finding Slackbot](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/apartment-finding-slackbot/)

I will also recommend you take a few courses in python [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python) or some similar site.  

Join your local [PyLadies](http://www.pyladies.com/) meetup group (and/or other meetups) - I think you've experience how much easier it is to work in a team, so try to form one to practice with!  

If you can get 100 hours of practice writing python, you'll feel a lot more comfortable and less confused writing code :)  

## Congratulate yourself!

Programming is hard, frustration is part of the learning curve and you've all dealed with it admirably!
